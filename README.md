# Synthesis and Characterization of Graphitic Carbon Nitride (g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)

This project focuses on the synthesis of 2D graphitic carbon nitride (g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) nanosheets from melamine, followed by an extensive structural and microstructural characterization.

### Key Highlights:
- **Synthesis:** Developed g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets through a thermal condensation method using melamine.
- **Characterization Techniques:**
  - X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
  - Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy (SEM and TEM)
  - Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
  - UV-Visible Spectroscopy
  - Excitation-Dependent Photoluminescence (PL) Spectra
- **Properties Explored:** Investigated the unique electronic structure, suitable band gap, and excellent thermal and chemical stability of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>.

This work highlights g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>'s potential as a promising material for advanced applications in nanotechnology and materials science.
